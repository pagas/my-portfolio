# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building modern React applications. With the release of Next.js 15, we've seen incredible improvements in performance, developer experience, and new features.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 brings several exciting features:

1. **Improved Performance** - Faster build times and better runtime performance
2. **Enhanced App Router** - More powerful routing capabilities
3. **Turbopack** - The new bundler is now stable and incredibly fast
4. **React 19 Support** - Full support for the latest React features

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started is incredibly simple. Just run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the latest defaults.

## Key Features to Explore

### Server Components

Server Components are one of the most powerful features:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return <div>{/* Render your data */}</div>;
}
```

### File-Based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system that's intuitive and powerful:

- `app/page.tsx` → `/`
- `app/about/page.tsx` → `/about`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `/blog/*`

### Built-in Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes:

- Images with `next/image`
- Fonts with `next/font`
- Scripts with `next/script`

## Best Practices

Here are some tips for building great Next.js applications:

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when needed
2. **Leverage Static Generation** - Pre-render pages whenever possible
3. **Optimize Images** - Always use the `Image` component
4. **Code Splitting** - Next.js does this automatically!

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is an incredible framework that makes building modern web applications a joy. Whether you're building a personal blog, an e-commerce site, or a complex web application, Next.js has you covered.
